/**
 * Dead code that has callers is not dead (anton-23xe). stringer's `deadcode` collector resolves
 * references from the source it walks, and it does not follow every one: all ten `unused-function`
 * signals in the 2026-08-17 scan named a symbol with real call sites — `withOperator` has three,
 * `getRunById` two, the gardener fixture's helpers one suite each — every caller in a test file the
 * collector skipped. Each one still cost the health record a debt point and each triage pass the
 * judgment to re-derive that it was wrong.
 *
 * So a deadcode signal is checked against the tree before anyone counts it, in the same seam that
 * drops findings about untracked files (lib/stringer) — before annotation, so the health record and
 * the triage prompt see one set rather than one counting what the other dropped.
 *
 * The check is `git grep`, not a parse: the question is only whether the symbol's name occurs
 * anywhere outside the file that declares it, and the index already knows which files those are
 * without walking `node_modules` or a build dir. Conservative in the direction that matters — a tree
 * anton cannot search drops nothing, so an unsearchable repo over-reports rather than deleting a
 * finding nobody hears about again.
